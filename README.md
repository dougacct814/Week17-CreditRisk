# Week17-CreditRisk

## Background
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Your final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:

-Implement machine learning models.

-Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.

-Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Analysis

### Describe the precision and recall scores

- Random Oversampling:  99% precision, 61% recall, 75% F1. 
- SMOTE Oversampling:  99% precision, 69% recall, 81% F1.
- Undersampling:  99% precision, 41% recall, 58% F1
- Combination:  99% precision, 58% recall, 73% F1

### Final Recommendation and justification

SMOTE oversampling would be the most ideal as it has the highest balanced accuracy score for the overall model.
